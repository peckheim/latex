%\subsection{Inter-rack Interconnection Networks: State of the Art}













% I feel like it's better if you write a related work section after the evaluation and just write in the intro what's SOA 

% Talk data center networks and switches
	% Industry design and related work from academia
	% Mellanox, Omnipath, Broadcomm
	% Dally HPCA talk: what's important (latency, bandwidth (not all used), adaptivity, low average utilization (traffic patterns paper more inside rack), exascale, etc)
	% Silicon photonics tighter integration allows to use fewer devices, thereby less power and less costs
	% A few sentences on how SiP can solve that, refer to details in next section

% Talk on-board interconnects 
	% NVIDIA NVLink (what else exists? Paolo's paper, hypertransport? Intel?)
	% traffic requirements? reconfiguration useful at all? 
	% Silicon photonics role? 
	% A few sentences on how SiP can solve that, refer to details in next section
